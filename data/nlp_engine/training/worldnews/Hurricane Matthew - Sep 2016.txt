The Haitian Red Cross Society set up an online platform for information management with support from the IFRC Information Management (IM) Team. This platform is built for information and documents dissemination: Operation: Hurricane Matthew Dashboard. Initially dedicated to common vulnerability analysis, monitoring process and evaluation for all members of the RCRCM, the platform evolved to serve operational and coordination purposes. The backend tool also helped to define the budget and human resources (stored job descriptions) for each sector. Furthermore, the sectors of intervention that have been retained for the recovery phase of the operation (Health, WASH, Shelter, and Livelihoods) are planned and will be implemented in an integrated manner.

As of 03 June, areas worst affected by the passage of Hurricane Matthew are likely to remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) through June 2017.

Between June and September, most areas of the country will face Minimal (IPC Phase 1) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) acute food insecurity outcomes, while certain households will remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) in parts of the southern peninsula, upper Artibonite, and Sud-Est Department.
