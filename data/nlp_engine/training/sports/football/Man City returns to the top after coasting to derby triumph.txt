Man City returns to the top after coasting to derby triumph

Dortmund shades Der Klassiker; Real Betis stuns Barcelona in a 4-3 thriller
Manchester City opened up a 12-point gap on Manchester United just 12 games into the Premier League season and returned to the top of the table with a convincing 3-1 win in Sunday’s derby at the Etihad.

Early goals in each half from David Silva and Sergio Aguero put City in command and Ilkay Gundogan condemned United to a fourth league defeat of the season after Anthony Martial’s penalty had given the visitors hope.

Earlier in the day, Liverpool briefly occupied the top spot after a 2-0 win over Fulham followed by Chelsea’s goalless stalemate against Everton.

Barcelona lost at home in La Liga for the first time in more than two years as Real Betis pulled off a stunning 4-3 victory at the Camp Nou on Sunday, despite Lionel Messi scoring twice on his return from injury.

Barca last endured defeat on its own patch against Alaves in September 2016 but, following 42 games unbeaten, its run was halted by a brilliant, counter-attacking display from Betis.

Godin bails out Atletico
Earlier on Saturay, Diego Godin played on injured for half an hour and then scored a 91st-minute winner as Atletico Madrid twice came from behind to beat Athletic Bilbao 3-2 in La Liga.

Paco Alcacer scored the winner as Bundesliga leader Borussia Dortmund twice came from behind to beat defending champion Bayern Munich 3-2 and move seven points clear of its third-placed rival.

Lucien Favre’s Dortmund remains unbeaten and four points clear of second-placed Gladbach at the top of the table. After Lewandowski twice gave Bayern the lead at Signal Iduna Park against his former club, Dortmund captain Marco Reus hit two equalisers before substitute Alcacer struck in the 73rd minute.

Alcacer has now scored eight goals in six league appearances since signing on loan from Barcelona.
