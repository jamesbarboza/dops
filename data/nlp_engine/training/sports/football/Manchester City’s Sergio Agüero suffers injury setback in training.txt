Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero suffers injury setback in training
• Striker out of City’s match at Watford on Tuesday 
• Agüero also a doubt for Saturday’s trip to Chelsea

Sergio Agüero suffered an abductor injury in training on Monday, ruling him out of Manchester City’s game at Watford on Tuesday night and making the striker a doubt for Saturday’s trip to Chelsea.

The 30-year-old was rested by Pep Guardiola for last Saturday’s visit of Bournemouth because of muscle fatigue. After taking a full part in training with the first-team squad on Sunday Agüero suffered the muscle injury during Monday’s session.

He will have tests to determine whether he can play against Chelsea. It is thought the injury may sideline him for a maximum of two weeks. The Argentinian, who has 10 goals in 16 City appearances this term, missed last season’s corresponding fixture with Chelsea, which Guardiola’s side won 1-0.
