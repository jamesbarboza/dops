Arsenal show new steel under Emery to beat Spurs in pulsating London derby

Unai Emery's Arsenal announced themselves on the big stage with a pulsating London derby victory over Tottenham where they initially went ahead and then battled from behind with Lucas Torreira sealing a 4-2 victory.

It was Arsenal who looked the livlier in the opening stages and justifiably went ahead through a Pierre-Emerick Aubamey penalty after ten minutes before Spurs got back into the contest.


Eric Dier glanced a near post header from a Christian Eriksen free-kick to bring the scores level and then just four minutes later they took the lead with a Harry Kane penalty after Rob Holding slid in and Heung-Min Son went down under the challenge.

It appeared as though Arsenal's moment had gone, but this is a new look side under Emery and they responded with Aubameyang's fine equaliser.

Alexandre Lacazette and Lucas Torreira then struck to finish off Tottenham and Emery's celebrations showed how much the victory means to them.
