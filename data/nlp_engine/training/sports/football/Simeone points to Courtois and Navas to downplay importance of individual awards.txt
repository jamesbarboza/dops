Simeone points to Courtois and Navas to downplay importance of individual awards


Diego Costa set for three months out

The Ballon d'Or is the topic of the day, but Diego Simeone has explained that he isn't a big fan of individual awards.

Using the example of the 2013/14 LaLiga best goalkeeper award, he spoke of why he doesn't take them too seriously.

"You guys make me laugh because you want me to say something you already know," Simeone told reporters when asked in a press conference on Tuesday about individual awards and whether or not Atletico Madrid players are less likely to be chosen.

"You already know.

"Courtois went to Real Madrid and earned the title of being the best goalkeeper in the world, but when he was with us Keylor Navas won the prize when he was at Levante.

"You know this, no?

"It's much more difficult to play at Atletico than at other places because our story has always been more about work and effort.

"As for [Antoine] Griezmann, I'll repeat what I told him.

"If I were in his position then I'd be happy for all that happened to me in this past year.

"He won the World Cup, which is very difficult.

"After that, each person can decide and pick whoever they think.

"I congratulate [Luka] Modric because I'm sure he had a good season.

"But, for me, the best ones were [Raphael] Varane and Griezmann."

Another star player at Atletico is Diego Costa, but he'll be out for the foreseeable future as a result of an operation on an injury.

"Along with the medical team, he has made the decision to stop," Simeone said.

"He has been making a huge effort for some time, with a lot of difficulty.

"We need him at his best.

"I'm content because we'll have a very important boost for the end of the season.

"We've not spoken about [a January signing] with the club.

"I'll look for solutions that help us to keep competing.

"We have several options for that position and we'll see who adapts best to what the team needs."
