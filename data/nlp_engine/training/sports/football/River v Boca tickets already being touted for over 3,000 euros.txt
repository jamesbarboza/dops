River v Boca tickets already being touted for over 3,000 euros

The madness that has accompanied the news that the Copa Libertadores is to be played at the Santiago Bernabeu has now hit Spanish shores.

The much-anticipated fixture has seen tickets selling online go in a matter of hours and, such was the frenzy to obtain a seat to see arch Argentine rivals River and Boca go head to head, the site crashed.

Tickets were going from 80 euros all the way up to 220 euros in a two-hour flash sale.


But controversy has arisen as it is thought that people will be looking to sell on the tickets to travelling Argentinean fans, desperate closer to the fixture date to get into Real Madrid's stadium.


Fears have been confirmed with reports of offers for resale tickets having skyrocketed to an eye-watering 3,160 euros. These could go even higher as the game is still a week away, finally confirmed to take place on the 9th December.
