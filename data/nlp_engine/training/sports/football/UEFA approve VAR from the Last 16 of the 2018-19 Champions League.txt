UEFA approve VAR from the Last 16 of the 2018/19 Champions League


UEFA approves third club competition

UEFA's plan against a Super League

The knockout stages of the Champions League will see the introduction of VAR after UEFA approved the use of the technology for the remainder of the 2018/19 tournament.

UEFA president, Aleksander Ceferin, has long been a champion of the use of technology to assist officials, however he wanted every piece of information on the system before permitting it to be used in the governing body's primary competition.

Ceferin has taken his proposal to the members of UEFA's Executive Committee and it's expected that VAR will enter at the Last 16 stage of the competition.

One of the instances that increased the desire for this progressive move was Raheem Sterling's ghost penalty against Shakhtar Donetsk in which the English forward was awarded a spot-kick, despite the fact he kicked the ground and was not fouled by the defender.

The 2018 World Cup in Russia was the highest profile use of VAR technology and it worked spectacularly well as it vastly improved the quality of the competition with the right decision often being found in contentious moment.

It was this that convinced Ceferin that the technology had to be implemented in the Champions League, and plans had already been put in place for it to be introduced at the start of the 2019/20 season.

VAR will also be used in the Europa League final this season, as well as the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals and the final phase of the 2019 European Under-21 Championship.

"We're ready to use VAR sooner than initially planned," Ceferin explained on Monday.

"We're convinced that it will be beneficial for our competitions as it will provide valuable help to the referees.

"This will allow us to reduce the number of incorrect decisions."

Valencia will be one of the teams lamenting that this technology was not in place sooner, however.
