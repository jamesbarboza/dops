The Ballon d'Or has little credit if Messi is fifth

The Ballon d'Or that Luka Modric won on Monday was the most hotly debated in recent years. While we've become used to the Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo duopoly, there were five or six players vying for the crown this year. There were opinions for all kinds of tastes. Looking at the votes, there were 13 different players who were voted in first place by one of the journalists consulted by France Football, namely Modric, Messi, Ronaldo, Antoine Griezmann, Kylian Mbappe, Raphael Varane, Sergio Aguero, Karim Benzema, Luis Suarez, Mohamed Salah, Thibaut Courtois, Neymar and Harry Kane.

This shows just how open the contest was and that the voting parameters are quite confusing. Modric was backed because of his Champions League win, World Cup runners-up medal and his play, even if he hasn't been as great in 2018/19. Ronaldo had a Champions League win, while Griezmann and Mbappe could speak about the World Cup. For Messi, there was his play, his goals and his Golden Shoe. The cases of Varane, Aguero, Courtois and the others were less obvious.

What is clearly unfair is that Messi isn't on the podium as one of the best. He demonstrates it every day. He himself won three quarters of Barcelona's league title last season, while he was also the Pichichi and Golden Shoe winner. In this season he is doing similarly well and if he didn't do more in the World Cup then it's worth taking a look at what he was working with.

In this year of 2018, which is what is supposed to be under consideration, he has played 50 matches and has scored 45 goals, while providing 23 assists. That means that he is directly involved in almost a goal and a half per match for his team. Messi deserved much more in this year's Ballon d'Or. Everyone, up to those at France Football, knows that.
