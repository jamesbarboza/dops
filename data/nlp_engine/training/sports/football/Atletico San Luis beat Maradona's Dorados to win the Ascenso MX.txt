Atletico San Luis beat Maradona's Dorados to win the Ascenso MX

The Apertura Finals in the Ascenso MX saw Atletico San Luis overcome a 1-0 first leg defeat against Dorados, coached by the legendary figure of Diego Maradona, as they won 3-2 in 90 minutes, forcing the game to extra time where Atletico scored the winning goal in the 103rd minute.

Perhaps unsurprisingly given their name, this is the Mexican expansion team of Atletico Madrid and their coach Alfonso Sosa, a former Mexico international player, brought glory to his side with this Apertura title.

San Luis started the second leg better than Dorados but went behind in the 32nd minute to a Jorge Cordoba goal, giving Maradona's side a 2-0 advantage on aggregate, yet Sosa and his players fought back and scored a goal just before half-time through Nicolas Ibanez.


Eleven minutes after the half-time interval, Dorados striker Edson Rivera re-established his team's two-goal advantage as he made it 2-1 on the night, before an own goal from his teammate Diego Barbosa and an Ian Gonzalez goal gave San Luis a 3-2 lead with the score 3-3 on aggregate.

Playing the second leg at home, San Luis had the fans behind them going into extra time and that paid dividends as Leandro Torres made it 4-2, 4-3 across the two legs, as Sosa's side secured the title.

This is the third Ascenso MX title that Sosa has won as a coach, while Maradona - who had to sit in the stands after his sending off during the first leg - proved to be the victim of his own errors, even getting into an altercation with opposition fans after the match.
