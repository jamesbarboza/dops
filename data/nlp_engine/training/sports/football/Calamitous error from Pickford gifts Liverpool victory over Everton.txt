Calamitous error from Pickford gifts Liverpool victory over Everton

A calamitous error from Jordan Pickford gifted a goal for Divock Origi deep into stoppage time that gave Liverpool a 1-0 victory over Everton.

Jurgen Klopp sprinted onto the pitch to celebrate the breakthrough in a typically hardfought Merseyside derby where neither side had dominated and Everton showed some adventurous football.

A miscued pass from Van Dijk spun up and the ball may have hit the top of the crossbar and gone out of play but Pickford palmed it back onto the pitch where grateful substitute Origi headed home.

Klopp's reaction showed how important the victory was for Liverpool who are two points off leaders Manchester City with 36 points from 14 games.

Everton haven't won now in 18 matches against Liverpool and lie sixth in the table with 22 points.
