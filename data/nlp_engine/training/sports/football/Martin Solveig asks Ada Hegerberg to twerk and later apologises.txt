Martin Solveig asks Ada Hegerberg to twerk and later apologises


Ada Hegerberg named women's Ballon d'Or winner

Ada Hegerberg won the first women's Ballon d'Or on Monday night, but the moment might be remembered for all the wrong reasons after DJ and presenter Martin Solveig asked her if she could twerk.

The French host asked the Lyon and Norway player if she knows how to do the dance, to which she quickly replied no.

This sparked outrage on social media, with many users wondering if Solveig would have asked the same question of a male winner.

He later shared a video on Twitter apologising for any offence caused.

"I am a little bit amazed by what I am reading on the internet," he said in the video.

"I, of course, didn't want to offend anyone.

"This comes from a distortion of my English level and my English culture level, which is obviously not enough because I didn't mean to offend anyone and didn't know this could be seen as such an offence especially if you consider the sequence in total, when we ended up dancing to Frank Sinatra.

"This was a joke, probably a bad one.

"I want to apologise for the one I may have offended.

"Sorry about that."

He also explained that he spoke to Hegerberg afterwards to discuss the incident.
