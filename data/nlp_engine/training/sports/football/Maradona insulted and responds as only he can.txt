Maradona insulted and responds as only he can

The dream of Diego Maradona and Dorados did not end in the way that they had hoped after losing 4-3 on aggregate to Atletico San Luis in the Ascenso MX'sApertura Finals.

Dorados' technical director threw a punch in response to the provocations of Atletico's supporters towards the Argentine.

A video of the incident shows people directing abuse at Maradona, who reacted by striking out.

The 58-year-old had been forced to watch the game in a box because of a suspension from the first leg.

In another video, Maradona is seen confronting the security guards at the Estadio Alfonso Lastras because he wanted to face the fans that offended him face-to-face and understandably, they tried to control him.
