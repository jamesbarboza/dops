Bala Devi scores four

Bala Devi struck four goals to power the Indian women’s football team to a 7-1 win over Bangladesh in its second match of the 2020 AFC Olympic qualifiers here on Sunday.

Kamala Devi produced a brace and Sanju scored once as India left behind the disappointment of the draw against Nepal.

The first half started off evenly but after the opening goal from India, it became a one-sided affair as an eight-minute blitz featuring three goals completely left the Bangladeshi players shell-shocked at the Thuwunna Stadium.

The Bangladesh side picked up a consolation goal with 10 minutes to go when Krishna Rani scored from a tight angle to deny the Indians a clean sheet.

The result:

India 7 (Bala Devi 4, Kamala Devi 2, Sanju) bt Bangladesh 1 (Krishna Rani).
