Bayern announce Ribery and Robben's retirements

The president of Bayern Munich, Uli Hoeness, announced on Sunday morning that Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben will retire at the end of this season.

Frenchman Ribery, aged 35, has played for the Bavarians since 2007, and his Dutch teammate Robben, aged 34, joined in 2009.

During these years, both have been key figures in the team, with whom they have won, among other titles, six consecutive leagues and the Champions League in 2013 against their traditional rivals, Borussia Dortmund.

"Both are playing their final year," Hoeness confirmed during a visit to a supporters club in the town of Kersbach in southern Germany.
