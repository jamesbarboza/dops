James Rodriguez: If I have to leave Bayern because I am not playing then I will go


Bayern set to turn down chance to sign James Rodriguez on permanent deal

James Rodriguez has made it clear that he would look to leave Bayern Munich if he is unable to win a place in Niko Kovac's side when he recovers from injury.

The Colombian is expected to be out for another two weeks at most with a knee problem.

"It is a different situation to last season, we are not competing for as much with the new coach and so we cannot promise as much," said James.

"If I have to go because I am not playing then I will go. You know that I want to stay because I feel the love of the fans and all the Bayern family.


"I feel good right now, I want to be fully recovered in one or two weeks. We are working hard to get better results."

James joined Bayern at the start of last season on a two year loan deal with an option to buy from Real Madrid.
