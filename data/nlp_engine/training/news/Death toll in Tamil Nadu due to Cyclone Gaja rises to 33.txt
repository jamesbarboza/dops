In Tamil Nadu, relief measures are being carried out on a war-footing in the areas hit by Cyclone Gaja. So far, 33 people have lost their lives. More than 11,000 staff are involved in resuming power connections in affected areas.

Mobile medical teams have also been mobilised. The Indian Navy has offered its support to the state authorities for relief works. Two ships - INS Chetlat and INS Cheriam - have been diverted to Karaikal near Puducherry to render assistance. Three ships Darshak, Carnicobar and Coradivh are kept on standby in Chennai. Two other vessels Ranvir and Khanjar are anchored at Vishakhapatnam to join in the relief efforts at short notice.
