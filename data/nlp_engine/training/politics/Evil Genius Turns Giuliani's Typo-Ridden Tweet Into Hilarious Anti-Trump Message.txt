Evil Genius Turns Giuliani's Typo-Ridden Tweet Into Hilarious Anti-Trump Message
One Twitter user said "whoever snagged that URL is a gdamn national treasure."

An angry tweet that Rudolph Giuliani intended to criticize Robert Mueller turned into an anti-Donald Trump message thanks to numerous typos.

On Friday, Giuliani sent this message out to the world.

Well, because Giuliani didn’t put a space after the period in the first sentence, he inadvertently created an unintentional URL: G-20.In.

As a result, some observant person on the internet decided to post something at that link for people who might click on it out of curiosity.

McAfee claims the link is spyware so click at your risk, but many Twitter users were amused.

 This is priceless. This imbecile made a typo that created a link. Click on it and see what opens. ??

Whoever did this, I will hoist several mugs of good Finnish microbrews this evening in your honour. ????

We all needed this today. To the human who did this, we ?? you and the employer who pays your salary while creating this gem for the rest of us. If you are unemployed, you won’t be for long.
