Social network Gab down as GoDaddy suspends hosting service

Gab, the far-right social network, has gone offline after domain registrar GoDaddy gave the platform 24 hours to find a new domain provider. It comes after it was found that the suspect, who allegedly shot and killed 11 people in Pittsburgh, used to post anti-semitic conspiracy theories on Gab. GoDaddy said the site hosted content that "encourages violence against people".
