Twitter suspends fake account of Russian President Putin

Twitter has said that it has suspended an account for impersonating Russian President Vladimir Putin on its platform. The "@putinRF_eng" account, created in November 2012, was removed for "impersonation based on a valid report" that Twitter received from Russian officials, it further said. The account mainly posted official government links to the Russian President's public appearances.
