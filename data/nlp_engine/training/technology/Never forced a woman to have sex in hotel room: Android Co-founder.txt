Never forced a woman to have sex in hotel room: Android Co-founder

Android Co-founder Andy Rubin on Thursday refuted a New York Times report that claimed he forced an employee into oral sex during an extramarital affair in 2013. "I never coerced a woman to have sex in a hotel room. These false allegations are part of a smear campaign to disparage me during a divorce and custody battle," tweeted Rubin.
