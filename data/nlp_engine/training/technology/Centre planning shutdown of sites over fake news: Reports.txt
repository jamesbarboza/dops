Centre planning shutdown of sites over fake news: Reports

The Indian government is reportedly planning amendments to the Information Technology (IT) Act to shut down apps and websites which fail to control fake news and child pornography. The central government had initiated amendments to the act in August. Section 69A of the IT Act currently allows the government to block public access to the platforms over such content violations.
