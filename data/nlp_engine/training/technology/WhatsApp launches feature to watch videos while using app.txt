WhatsApp launches feature to watch videos while using app

Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp has launched a new feature that lets users watch videos while they use the app. The video links sent in the message open up in a window which can be dragged anywhere across the display. The mode, called Picture-in-Picture (PIP), will support video platforms such as YouTube, Instagram and Facebook.
