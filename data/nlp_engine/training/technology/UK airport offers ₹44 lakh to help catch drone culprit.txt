The UK's Gatwick Airport has offered a ₹44.3-lakh reward for information to help catch the drone culprit, who caused it to shut down three times last week. Around 1,000 aircraft had been cancelled or diverted and nearly 1.4 lakh passengers were left stranded due to drone sightings since Wednesday night. Police had arrested two individuals who have now been released.
