Facebook denies disbanding 'war room' 2 months after launch

Facebook has denied reports claiming the election 'war room' has been disbanded within two months of its launch. "The war room was effective and we're not disbanding it, we're going to do more things like this," Facebook's VP of Product Management Guy Rosen said. Earlier, it was reported that Facebook never intended the 'war room' to be permanent.
