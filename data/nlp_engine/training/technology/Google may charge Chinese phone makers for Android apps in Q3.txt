Google may charge Chinese phone makers for Android apps in Q3

Google has revealed plans to charge Chinese smartphone manufacturers like Huawei, ZTE, Xiaomi among "many" others for Android apps in the third quarter of 2019. This comes after Google in July 2018 faced a $5-billion fine by EU for “illegally tying” the Chrome and search apps to Android. Google has reportedly never charged for Android and its apps before.
