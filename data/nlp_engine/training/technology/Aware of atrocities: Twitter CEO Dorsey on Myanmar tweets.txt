Aware of atrocities: Twitter CEO Dorsey on Myanmar tweets

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday tweeted he was "aware of the human rights atrocities and suffering in Myanmar" in response to criticism over his tweets about a meditation retreat in the country. "I didn't intend to diminish by not raising the issue," he added. Dorsey was criticised over not mentioning Rohingya Muslims' ethnic cleansing in his tweets about Myanmar.
