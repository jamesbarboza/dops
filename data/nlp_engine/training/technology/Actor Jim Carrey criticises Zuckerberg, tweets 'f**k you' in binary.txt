Actor Jim Carrey criticises Zuckerberg, tweets 'f**k you' in binary

American-Canadian actor Jim Carrey has criticised Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a tweet which reads 'f**k you' in binary code. This comes after a New York Times report accused Facebook of running a lobbying campaign to promote negative stories about its political critics and rivals Apple and Google. This is the third time Carrey criticised Zuckerberg on Twitter this year.
