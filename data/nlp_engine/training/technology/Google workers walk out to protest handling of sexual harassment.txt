Google workers walk out to protest handling of sexual harassment

Hundreds of Google employees around the world are staging walkouts to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment cases. The walkout organisers said Google must end forced arbitration, and publicly report sexual harassment statistics. This follows a report that said Google in 2014 gave a $90-million exit package to Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin after he was accused of sexual harassment.
