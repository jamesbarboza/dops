Satanic Temple sues Netflix for $50mn for using statue in show

The Satanic Temple, a religious activist group, has sued Netflix and Warner Bros for over $50 million for unauthorized use of a statue in the series "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina." It alleged the series copied the group's statue of the goat-headed deity Baphomet. By implying the statue "stands for evil", the show caused injury to their reputation, the group said.
