Apple not in talks with Qualcomm over $7 bn dispute: Report

Apple is not in talks "at any level" to settle its $7 billion legal dispute with mobile chip maker Qualcomm, according to reports. Report also suggested the iPhone maker is preparing to go to trial. It comes after Apple sued Qualcomm last year alleging the company's practice of taking a cut from iPhone sales as patent license fee was illegal.
