Tencent to check gamers' ages, IDs amid addiction criticism

Chinese gaming and social media giant Tencent is planning to bring a verification system to check all gamersâ€™ identities and ages against police databases by 2019. Earlier, China had announced plans to curb video-games to tackle addiction issues in children. The system is also meant to address the "sale of personal information online", Tencent said.
