Twitter shares fall 8.7% post reports of boycott by Fox News

Twitter shares fell by around 8.7% on Thursday after reports claimed that the micro-blogging platform is facing a boycott from agencies such as Fox News. This reportedly comes as a silent protest over how Twitter handled harassment against one of Fox News' hosts. The news agency, owned by 21st Century Fox, has not tweeted on the platform since November 8.
