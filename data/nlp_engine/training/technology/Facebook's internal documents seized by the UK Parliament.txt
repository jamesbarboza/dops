Facebook's internal documents seized by the UK Parliament

The UK Parliament has seized some internal Facebook documents from US-based company Six4Three after Mark Zuckerberg refused to testify over the data scandal. "This is an unprecedented move but it's an unprecedented situation," UK MP Damian Collins said. The files reportedly include details on Cambridge Analytica scandal, including emails between executives and conversations with Zuckerberg.
