Google, FB, Yahoo block keywords related to child porn in India

Internet majors like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo have started blocking keywords related to child porn and sexual violence in India. India's Supreme Court had earlier said these firms were not doing enough to suppress such content. The step was suggested by a committee formed by the Supreme Court following a petition filed by non-profit organisation Prajwala in 2015.
