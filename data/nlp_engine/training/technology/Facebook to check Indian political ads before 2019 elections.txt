Facebook to check Indian political ads before 2019 elections

Facebook has announced it will confirm the identity and location of Indian advertisers wanting to run political ads on the platform ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. "By authorizing advertisers...we can better defend against foreign interference in India's elections," Facebook said. It added it will also show a disclaimer on all political ads with advertisers' information from next year.
