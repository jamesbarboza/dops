Been considering edit button for quite some time: Twitter CEO

While talking about the tweet edit feature, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey at a recent event said, "We have been considering edit (button) for quite some time but have to do it the right way." Adding that they cannot just "rush it out", Dorsey also said, "We can't make something which is distracting or takes anything away from the public record."
