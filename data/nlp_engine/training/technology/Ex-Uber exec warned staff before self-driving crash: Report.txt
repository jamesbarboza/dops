Ex-Uber exec warned staff before self-driving crash: Report

A former Uber manager Robert Miller had reportedly warned Uber’s executives about safety issues before the fatal self-driving car crash in Arizona in March. “The cars are routinely in accidents resulting in damage. This is not how we should be operating,” Miller had said. He added, “Several of the drivers appear to not have been properly vetted or trained.”
