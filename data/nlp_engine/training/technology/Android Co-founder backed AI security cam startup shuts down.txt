Android Co-founder backed AI security cam startup shuts down

Android Co-founder Andy Rubin backed AI-powered smart security camera startup Lighthouse has shut down its operations. "We did not achieve the commercial success we were looking for," CEO Alex Teichman said, asking customers to check their email for refund process details. The startup was to reportedly ship the device by September 2017 but hadn't done so until February 2018.
