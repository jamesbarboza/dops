Accusations couldn't be further from truth: FB on NYT report


Facebook in a blog post has said that the accusations made against it in a New York Times (NYT) report could not be further from the truth. The report accused Facebook's moderation team of relying on guidelines of over 1,400 pages which contained 'inaccurate' information. Facebook further said the debate on moderation should be based on facts and not mischaracterisations.
