Facebook starts rolling out unsend feature on Messenger

Facebook Messenger has started rolling out its unsend feature that lets users delete messages from chat within 10 minutes of sending. The feature, which will be released globally soon, has been released on Android and iOS in Poland, Bolivia, Colombia and Lithuania. The deleted messages will be retained for a short time in case a receiver reports them for harassment.
