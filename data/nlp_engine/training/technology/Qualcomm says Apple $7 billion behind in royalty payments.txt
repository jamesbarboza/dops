Qualcomm says Apple $7 billion behind in royalty payments

Qualcomm on Friday said that Apple is $7 billion behind in patent royalty payments to the US mobile chipmaker. Qualcomm had accused Apple of patent infringement after Apple alleged that it engaged in unfair patent licensing practices. Apple, which had halted royalty payments to Qualcomm in 2017, argued that Qualcomm is forcing it to pay for the same patents twice.
