Apply FDI norms on domestic online firms too: Traders' body

Traders' body CAIT said the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms for e-commerce companies should be implemented on domestic online players also to discourage unethical practices. CAIT also urged the government to immediately release the proposed policy for the sector. The government recently barred online retailers from selling products of companies in which they have a stake.
