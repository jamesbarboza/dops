Lawmakers post empty seat pic after FB CEO doesn't show up

Lawmakers from the UK and other nations have criticised Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for not appearing to testify over data scandal by sharing a picture of an empty seat. "Where is Mark Zuckerberg?" UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee tweeted. "Never seen anything like Facebook...our institutions...have been upended by frat-boy billionaires from California," a Canadian lawmaker said.
