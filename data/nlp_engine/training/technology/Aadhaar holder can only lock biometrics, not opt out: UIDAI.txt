Aadhaar holder can only lock biometrics, not opt out: UIDAI

Responding to an RTI query, the UIDAI has said that an Aadhaar card holder can lock his biometrics but may not opt out of it as suggested by the Supreme Court. In September, the apex court had directed that persons enrolled before enforcement of the Aadhaar Act two years ago need to be given an option to exit Aadhaar.
