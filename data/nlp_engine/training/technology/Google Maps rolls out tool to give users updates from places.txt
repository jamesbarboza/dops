Google Maps rolls out tool to give users updates from places

Google is rolling out a feature called 'Follow' on Google Maps to give users updates from places such as restaurants or stores that they follow. The updates will appear in the 'For you' tab on Google Maps. Businesses can also create profiles on the platform to reach out to customers before they open to the public, the company said.
