Those working with China compromise values: Alphabet Chairman

Google parent Alphabet's Chairman John Hennessy has said, "Anybody who does business in China compromises some of their core values." Adding that it includes "every single company", Hennessy also said that it's "because the laws in China are quite a bit different than they are in our own (the US) country". Notably, Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010.
