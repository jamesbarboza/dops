Apple, Qualcomm court hearing set for April 15 next year

A US judge has set the court hearing for Apple and Qualcomm for April 15, 2019, amidst lack of settlement talks between the two parties. Apple had accused Qualcomm of overcharging for patents, charging both when it licenses its patent portfolio and when it sells its cellular modem chipsets. Qualcomm, on the other hand, charged Apple with intellectual property theft.
