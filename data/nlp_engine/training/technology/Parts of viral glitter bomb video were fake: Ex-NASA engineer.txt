Parts of viral glitter bomb video were fake: Ex-NASA engineer

After his glitter bomb video to trap parcel thieves went viral, YouTuber and former NASA engineer Mark Rober apologised saying two out of the five reactions in his video were staged. Rober added he wasn't aware the people in the video were his friends' acquaintances. Rober's device shot glitter and fart smells at thieves who tried to open the package.
