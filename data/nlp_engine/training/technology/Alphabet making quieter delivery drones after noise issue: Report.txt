Alphabet making quieter delivery drones after noise issue: Report

Alphabet-owned drone delivery startup Wing is reportedly working on making quieter drones after facing noise-related issues in its trial, which it has been conducting in Australia since 2014. The report claimed the speed of the drones was also slowed down. This comes after the startup recently announced it will launch its drone-delivery service in Finland in the spring of 2019.
