Scamsters use Google Maps loophole to dupe BOI customers

A group of Thane-based fraudsters allegedly used a loophole in Google Maps to edit Bank of India's (BOI) branch contact information to get customers to share sensitive account details, according to Maharashtra cyber police. Customers’ CVV numbers and PINs were then used to withdraw money from their accounts. “We immediately notified the authorities at Google,” Maharashtra cyber police said.
