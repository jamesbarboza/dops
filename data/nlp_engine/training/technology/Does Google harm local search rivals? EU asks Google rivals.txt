Does Google harm local search rivals? EU asks Google rivals

The European Union antitrust regulators have asked Google’s rivals if Google unfairly demotes local search competitors, according to Reuters. They inquired about details of the company’s practices and the impact on competing services between January 2012 to December 2017. This follows a complaint by US-based search company Yelp and rivals in travel, restaurant and accommodation industries.
