New Australia law to give police access to encrypted chat

Australia is set to pass legislation giving police and intelligence agencies access to encrypted messages on platforms such as WhatsApp. The government reached an in-principle agreement after changes were made to “include limiting the application of the powers in this bill to only serious offences,” Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said. Technology giants such as Facebook and Google oppose it.
