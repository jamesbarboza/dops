Qualcomm wins Apple patent case, may lead to iPhone ban in Germany

A German court has ruled that Apple infringed a hardware patent of Qualcomm and said it could no longer sell some iPhone models in Germany. The court, however, added the ruling will not go into immediate effect if Apple appeals. The ruling affects iPhone 7 through iPhone X models, which contain a particular component that violated a Qualcomm patent.
