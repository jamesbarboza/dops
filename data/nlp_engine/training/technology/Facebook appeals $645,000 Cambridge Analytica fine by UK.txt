Facebook appeals $645,000 Cambridge Analytica fine by UK

Facebook has appealed against fine of around $645,000 imposed by the UK's data watchdog over the company's role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The company argued that the UK regulators failed to prove that British users were directly affected by the scandal. It was initially reported that the details of about 1.1 million UK-based users had been exposed.
