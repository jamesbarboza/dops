Facebook CEO Zuckerberg refuses to testify over fake news

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has refused to testify over fake news before a joint parliamentary committee from five countries including British and Canadian federal governments. Facebook in a letter argued it wasn't possible for Zuckerberg to appear before all the parliaments. The committee, set to meet on November 27, wanted Zuckerberg to answer questions on the Cambridge Analytica data leak.
