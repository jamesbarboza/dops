WhatsApp launches first-ever TV campaign to fight fake news

WhatsApp on Monday launched its first-ever television campaign in India called 'Share Joy, Not Rumours' to address fake news ahead of 2019 general elections. It comprises three 60-second films that convey scenarios about dangerous rumours that spread via spam among user groups. “The campaign is timed to start just prior to the elections in Rajasthan and Telangana,” WhatsApp said.
