I lived in a small house, slept on floor: Google CEO Pichai

Remembering his childhood home in Chennai, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said, "We lived in a kind of modest house, shared with tenants. We would sleep on the living room floor." "Other houses had refrigerators, and then we finally got one. It was a big deal," said Pichai, who joined Google in 2004, after studying from IIT Kharagpur and Stanford University.
