After Instagram founders, 2 top Instagram execs quit Facebook

Facebook-owned Instagram's two senior executives Bangaly Kaba and Ameet Ranadive have resigned from the company. While Kaba was Head of Growth at Instagram, Ranadive lead the Well-being Product team on the app. This comes after Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger exited Facebook in September reportedly over growing tensions with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
