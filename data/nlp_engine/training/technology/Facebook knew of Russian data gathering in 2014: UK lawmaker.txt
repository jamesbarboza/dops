Facebook knew of Russian data gathering in 2014: UK lawmaker

Facebook knew about Russian-linked entities harvesting data through advertising on the platform in 2014, UK MP Damian Collins said. Collins found that a Facebook engineer had highlighted suspicious Russian activity on the platform in an internal email he reviewed. However, Facebook has said, “The engineers who had flagged these initial concerns… found no evidence of specific Russian activity.”
