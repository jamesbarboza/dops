YouTube posts creator's video without credit, says it 'forgot'

YouTube was criticised on Twitter after it posted a Christmas holiday video of a professional domino artist named Lily Hevesh without crediting her. "People rip off my work every day and it's honestly saddening to see this happen by YouTube itself," Hevesh said. YouTube later tweeted "Our mistake - we forgot to credit Lily Hevesh for this video!"
