Steve Jobs would be very proud of Apple's innovations: Wozniak

Apple's Co-founder Steve Wozniak in an interview on Tuesday said that late Co-founder Steve Jobs would be "very happy" with Apple's innovation if he was alive. "Apple's concern is more with end users and putting people above technology. Steve always acted that way," he added. â€œEvery other phone company had to come along and copy Apple," he further said.
