Ramdev's Patanjali cancels relaunch of Kimbho app: Reports

Baba Ramdev's Patanjali has reportedly dropped plans of relaunching its messaging app 'Kimbho'. The company made two unsuccessful attempts to launch the app in May and August after facing security-related challenges. "We wanted to launch a technically sound application which could promise water-tight security and privacy. However, we're not satisfied with the work done," Patanjali CEO and MD said.
