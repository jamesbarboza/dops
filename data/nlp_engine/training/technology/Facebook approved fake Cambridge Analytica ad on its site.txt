Facebook approved fake Cambridge Analytica ad on its site

Facebook earlier this week approved a fake political advertisement marked as "paid for by Cambridge Analytica", the British data firm involved in the social network's data scandal. The ad, now removed but still visible on Facebook's ad transparency portal, reads, "Our current system is broken." The ad surpassed Facebook's verification process which ran for two days to a limited audience.
