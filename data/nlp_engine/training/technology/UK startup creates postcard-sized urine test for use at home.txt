UK startup creates postcard-sized urine test for use at home

UK-based medtech startup TestCard has created an at-home postcard-sized urine test, similar to a pregnancy test, which is analysed by an accompanying app to provide immediate results. The urine test, which has no electronic components involved, will launch in the UK in April 2019. TestCard also plans to screen diabetes products in India, TestCard's Co-founder and CSO Andrew Botham revealed.
