Child pornography vile, we have no place for it: WhatsApp

Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp on Friday said that child pornography is 'vile' and has no place on the platform. WhatsApp added it responds to valid legal requests from law enforcement to investigate such crimes. A spokesperson further said that while encryption blocks them from viewing user messages, they "can and do take action based on user reports including banning accounts."
