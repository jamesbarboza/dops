'Abhi Na Jao C***d Kar': Users claim song censored on Amazon Alexa

Dubai-based user Rohit Bharati on Tuesday pointed out that Hindi song 'Abhi Na Jao Chhod Kar' was beeped while using Saavn. The music streaming application responded, "We're certain this is correct on Saavn, and not exactly sure where the filtering is coming from." Another user later tweeted "Amazon is the culprit here", implying it's virtual assistant Alexa censored the song.
