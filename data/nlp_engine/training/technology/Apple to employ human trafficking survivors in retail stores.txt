Apple to employ human trafficking survivors in retail stores

Apple has said it will employ human trafficking survivors to work in its retail stores. It comes after the company won an international award in its efforts to help end slave labour. "As a company whose work touches...so many people, we feel we have an enormous responsibility...to turn our values into action," Apple's retail head Angela Ahrendts said.
