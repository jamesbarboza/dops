Apple removes app which portrayed homosexuality as 'sin'

Apple has removed religious group Living Home Ministries' app from App Store after it was accused of portraying homosexuality as a 'sin' by an LGBTQ rights group. In a petition, the group alleged the app sought for LGBTQ youth "to change from gay-to-straight through prayer and therapy". "We thank Apple for...taking swift action to remove dangerous app," the group said.
