Device that can be kept in eyes to monitor sugar level made

Dutch startup NovioSense has developed a glucose monitor that can be placed in the lower eyelid to measure sugar level in tears. It works by tapping into "basal tears", or a continuous stream of tears that don't require stimulation. The spring-like coil can sit in the eyelid for long periods and won't be displaced even if users' rub their eyes.
