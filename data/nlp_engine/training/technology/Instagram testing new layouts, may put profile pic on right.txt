Instagram testing new layouts, may put profile pic on right

Facebook-owned photo-sharing app Instagram has announced that it is testing new user profile layouts to make them "easier and cleaner to use". Users "may see features re-arranged" at the top of their profiles including changes to icons, buttons and how they navigate between tabs, Instagram said. Profile pictures could also be put on the right side in the new layout.
