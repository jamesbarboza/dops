Children should be allowed internet during exams: Prof Sugata Mitra

UK's Newcastle University professor and the 2013 Ted Prize winner Sugata Mitra has said that the children should be allowed to use the internet in their exams. He also said that the internet should be introduced as a formal subject in the school. "Children in the self-organised learning environment can learn anything by themselves," he added.
