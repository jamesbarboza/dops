EU plans to test AI-based lie detector at border points

The European Union is planning to test an AI-based lie-detector system at certain border checkpoints to screen travellers coming into Europe. The system, which is part of a larger project named 'iBorderCtrl', will use AI to detect 'facial micro-expressions' that can reveal when someone is lying. The experimental trials will begin in Hungary, Greece and Latvia.
