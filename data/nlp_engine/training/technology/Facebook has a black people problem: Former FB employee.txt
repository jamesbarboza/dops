Facebook has a black people problem: Former FB employee

A former Facebook employee has accused the company of having a 'black people problem' in an internal memo. "Facebook’s disenfranchisement of black people on the platform mirrors the marginalisation of its black employees," Mark Luckie, former manager of partnerships at Facebook said. "In some buildings, there are more ‘Black Lives Matter’ posters than there are actual black people," he added.
