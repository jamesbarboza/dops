Two App Store fitness apps use Touch ID to scam users

Two fitness apps on the App Store 'Fitness Balance' and 'Calories Tracker' were using Touch ID to scam users, according to a security researcher who reported the apps. They asked users to "scan" their fingerprint for health data and hold it for ten seconds. While this was happening, an in-app purchase popped up, which was authenticated via the Touch ID.
