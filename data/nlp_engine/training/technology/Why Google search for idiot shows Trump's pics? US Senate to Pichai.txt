Why Google search for idiot shows Trump's pics? US Senate to Pichai

A US lawmaker on Tuesday asked Google CEO Sundar Pichai that why do US President Donald Trump's pictures show up on Google search for 'idiot'. Pichai explained, "We take the keyword...match it against web pages and rank them based on over 200 signals like popularity...and how people are using it." "Based on that, we find the search results," Pichai added.
