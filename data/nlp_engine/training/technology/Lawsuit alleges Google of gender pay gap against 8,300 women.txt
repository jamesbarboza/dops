Lawsuit alleges Google of gender pay gap against 8,300 women

Google is facing a class-action lawsuit alleging the company of gender pay discrimination against roughly 8,300 current and former women employees. The initial complaint, filed a year ago, alleged Google was paying women less than men for similar work. It comes amid reports claiming Google paid a $90-million severance package to an executive while hiding sexual misconduct allegations against him.
