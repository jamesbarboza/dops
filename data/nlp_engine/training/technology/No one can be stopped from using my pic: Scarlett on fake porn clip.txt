No one can be stopped from using my pic: Scarlett on fake porn clip

Talking about her fake pornographic video that racked up over 1.5 million views, actress Scarlett Johansson has said, "Nothing can stop someone from cutting and pasting my image or anyone else's onto a different body." "This doesn't affect me...people assume it's not actually me in a porno, however demeaning it is," she said. "Fighting deepfake porn is fruitless," she added.
