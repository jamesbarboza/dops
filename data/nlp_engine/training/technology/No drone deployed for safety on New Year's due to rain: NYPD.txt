No drone deployed for safety on New Year's due to rain: NYPD

New York Police Department (NYPD) Chief said the department cancelled its plans to deploy camera-equipped drones on New Year's Eve "due to rain and wind", adding the "safety of all those celebrating is paramount". NYPD had earlier announced its plans to deploy the drones for the first time to monitor the ball drop celebrations in the city's Times Square.
