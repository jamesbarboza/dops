Paris plans to launch e-bike fleet to curb pollution

The Paris region in north-central France plans to launch a large fleet of electric bicycles in a state-funded scheme called 'Veligo' to reduce congestion and pollution. The scheme will start with up to 10,000 e-bikes for rent. Users can rent the e-bikes for around $45 a month as part of the scheme.
