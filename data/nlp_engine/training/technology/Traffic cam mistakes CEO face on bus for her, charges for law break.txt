Traffic cam mistakes CEO face on bus for her, charges for law break

An artificial intelligence-based traffic camera system in China recognised the face of a woman CEO, Dong Mingzhu, on a bus advertisement and mistakenly charged her for crossing a road during a red light. The image of Mingzhu, CEO of China's biggest air-conditioner maker Gree Electric Appliances, was displayed on a city billboard used to shame those who break traffic laws.
