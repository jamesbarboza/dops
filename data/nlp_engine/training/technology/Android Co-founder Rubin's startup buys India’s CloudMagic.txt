Android Co-founder Rubin's startup buys India’s CloudMagic


Father of Android Andy Rubin's startup Essential Products has acquired Indian origin e-mail management startup CloudMagic for an undisclosed amount. This comes after CloudMagic shut down its subscription-based premium email service Newton in September. “We are always on the lookout for companies with great technology and talent to help accelerate our product roadmap,” Essential Products said.
