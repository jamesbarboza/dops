Court rejects man's request to reduce his age by 20 yrs for Tinder

Dutch court has rejected a 69-year-old man named Emile Ratelband's request to reduce his official age by 20 years to get more matches on dating app Tinder. Emile argued his official age didn't reflect his emotional state and made it difficult for him to find love. "Amending his age would cause 20 years of records to vanish," the court said.
