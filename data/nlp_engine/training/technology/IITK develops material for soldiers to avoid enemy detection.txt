IITK develops material for soldiers to avoid enemy detection

IIT Kanpur scientists have developed a textile-based material that can help defence personnel and vehicles avoid detection by enemy radars. “We have designed and produced micro-structured infra-red metamaterials that...can be readily scaled for mass production to cover large area surfaces,” an IIT Kanpur professor said. The infra-red metamaterials reduce thermal emission to avoid detection.
