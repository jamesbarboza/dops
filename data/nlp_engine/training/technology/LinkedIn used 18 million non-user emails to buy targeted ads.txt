LinkedIn used 18 million non-user emails to buy targeted ads

Microsoft-owned LinkedIn used the email addresses of 18 million non-users to buy targeted advertisements on Facebook, according to Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner. LinkedIn admitted to taking the emails without authorisation to get more people to sign up to the service. The investigation was prompted by a complaint from a user in 2017, over LinkedIn's practices regarding the non-members.
