Twitter CEO poses with Smash Brahminical Patriarchy poster, slammed

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was criticised for promoting hate speech after he was seen holding a placard that read "Smash Brahminical Patriarchy" during his India visit. Former Infosys Director Mohandas Pai demanded government action against the "hate mongering" while author Advaita Kala said, "When you say Twitter should be a space for healthy conversation shows how hollow those words are."
