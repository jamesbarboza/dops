China search engine was 'experiment': Google CEO Sundar Pichai

Google's controversial project, code-named 'Dragonfly', to make a customised search engine for China to meet the country's norms was an "experiment", CEO Sundar Pichai has said. Earlier, Pichai admitted the project was in early stages of development. The project received criticism from the company's own employees who argued that a project supporting censorship is against Google's values.
