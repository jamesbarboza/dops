Google asked to stop removing Portuguese app store from phones

Portuguese app store Aptoide has said that a local court ruled against Google in a landmark case, ordering the company to stop removing its app from users' smartphones without consent. "If you have reason on your side don't fear to challenge Google," Aptoide CEO Paulo Trezentos said. Aptoide made its first complaint to European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition in 2014.
