Free Huawei CFO or face consequences: China threatens Canada

China has threatened Canada with consequences if Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou is not immediately released, calling her arrest “unreasonable, unconscionable and vile in nature.” Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng urged Canadian ambassador to China John McCallum to release Meng. He told McCallum the arrest severely violated Meng's legitimate rights and interests as a Chinese citizen.
