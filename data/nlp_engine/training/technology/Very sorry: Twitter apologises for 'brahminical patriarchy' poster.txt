Very sorry: Twitter apologises for 'brahminical patriarchy' poster

After Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey faced criticism for posing with a poster saying 'smash Brahminical patriarchy', Twitter's legal head Vijaya Gadde said, "I'm very sorry for this. It's not reflective of our views." She added, "We took a private photo with a gift just given to us â€” we should have been more thoughtful."
