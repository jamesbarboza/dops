Undersea robot designed to deliver coral babies made

Australian scientists have designed an undersea robot, named LarvalBot, that can give birth to millions of baby corals. It can deliver baby coral larvae onto targeted reefs after the eggs and sperm of corals are developed into larvae in floating enclosures in around five to seven days. The robot was previously designed to protect reefs by killing coral-destroying crown-of-thorns starfish.
