Uber to resume self-driving car tests on public roads in US

Uber has received approval to resume self-driving car testing on public roads in Pennsylvania, US. Uber would resume testing with two employees in the front seat, enable an automatic braking system at all times, and more strictly monitor safety of employees. This comes nine months after an Uber self-driving car killed a pedestrian in Arizona and the program was suspended.
