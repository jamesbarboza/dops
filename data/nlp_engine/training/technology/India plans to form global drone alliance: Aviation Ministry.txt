India plans to form global drone alliance: Aviation Ministry

Civil Aviation Ministry Joint Secretary Shefali Juneja has said, “We are looking to form a drone alliance on the lines of Solar Alliance wherein other countries will accept regulations made collectively.” The Ministry plans to brainstorm further on the body during the Global Aviation Summit in January. This comes after India's first-ever drone policy came into effect on December 1.
