Facebook rolls out tool to let users track time spent on app

Facebook on Tuesday rolled out ‘Your time on Facebook’ tool to let users track the time they spend on Facebook on a particular device each day, for the past week and on average. It allows users to mute push notifications and set daily reminders for limiting app usage. The dashboard can be accessed through Facebook app's ‘settings & privacy’ tab.
