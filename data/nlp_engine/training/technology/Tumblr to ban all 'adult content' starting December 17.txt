Tumblr to ban all 'adult content' starting December 17

Blogging platform Tumblr has said that it will ban all "adult content", which includes "real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples, and any content...that depicts sex acts," starting December 17. It added existing adult content will be set to a "private mode" viewable only to the original poster. Notably, Tumblr was recently removed from Apple's App Store due to child pornography.
