Samsung shows 5G prototype smartphone with a corner notch

South Korean smartphone maker Samsung showed its 5G phone prototype at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii, which has a notch on the corner of the display. A front-facing camera was placed above the notch's bottom curve. "You should think of that device as a sample device. Not necessarily indicative of what the final device will look like," Samsung said.
