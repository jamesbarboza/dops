LinkedIn adds privacy setting to stop export of email IDs

Microsoft-owned professional networking service LinkedIn added a new privacy setting aimed to stop the email addresses of its users from being exported. "This is a new setting that gives our members even more control of their email address on LinkedIn," the company said. However, connections will still be able to view email address if they navigate to the user's profile.
