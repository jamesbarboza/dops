Apple lied about iPhone X screen size, resolution: Lawsuit

A lawsuit filed against Apple has claimed its iPhone X is not 'all screen' as marketed by the company, saying it counts non-screen areas like notch and corners to make the claim. The suit also alleges the phone is supposed to have a 2436x1125 resolution as advertised, but it does not contain true pixels with red, blue, and green subpixels.
