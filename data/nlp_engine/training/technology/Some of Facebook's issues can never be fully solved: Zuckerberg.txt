Some of Facebook's issues can never be fully solved: Zuckerberg

In an end-of-year post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that election interference and harmful speech are some of the issues that "can never fully be solved" by Facebook. "We've fundamentally altered our DNA to focus more on preventing harm in all our services," the 34-year-old billionaire added. However, Zuckerberg also said he was proud of the progress Facebook made.
