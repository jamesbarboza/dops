Qualcomm wins import ban against Apple's iPhones in China

Qualcomm on Monday announced it won a Chinese court order banning the import and sale of Apple’s iPhone 6S through iPhone X models in China due to software patent violations. The court found Apple violated two of Qualcomm’s software patents around resizing photographs and managing applications on a touchscreen. Apple, however, said that its iPhones remain on sale in China.
