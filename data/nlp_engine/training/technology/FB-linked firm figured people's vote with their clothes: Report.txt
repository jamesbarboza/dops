FB-linked firm figured people's vote with their clothes: Report

Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who exposed Facebook data scandal-linked firm Cambridge Analytica, has reportedly claimed it used fashion preferences of Facebook users to target them with political messages. People who preferred Abercrombie & Fitch were more liberal while those who liked Wrangler were more conservative, he said. The firm used about 87 million Facebook users' data to influence US elections.
