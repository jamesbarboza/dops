Company makes $2,700 crib with in-built iPad, faces backlash

UK-based furniture company Babeek has designed a $2,700 'smart' crib for babies which comes with an in-built iPad. Describing the creation as "outrageous", Gary Allen, a chartered educational psychologist, said, "Cots are a safe place for sleeping and resting-period." Further, a Facebook user said, "There's a limit for technology and this is just way over that limit."
