Judges, lawyers as Facebook friends won't affect case: US court 

The Florida Supreme Court on Thursday said judges need not disqualify themselves from cases in which they are "Facebook friends" with attorneys, adding "a Facebook friend may or may not be a friend". A Miami firm had moved the court believing it would not be given a fair trial as its case's judge and opposing attorney were friends on Facebook.
