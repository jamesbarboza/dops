Hope to work with Sandberg for decades: Facebook CEO


Defending Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's handling of company's disclosures about Russiaâ€™s influence on elections, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said, "I hope we work together for decades more to come." "Sheryl is a really important part of this company," he added. An NYT report recently alleged that Facebook knew about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections.
