Will pull out of US if trade war worsens: Ex-Google China head

A prominent venture capitalist and former president of Google China, Kai-Fu Lee, has said that his investment firm, Sinovation Ventures, will withdraw from the US if trade relations between the two countries worsen. "The easy thing for us to do is to look for smart, technical Chinese people in America and bring them back to China," Lee further said.
