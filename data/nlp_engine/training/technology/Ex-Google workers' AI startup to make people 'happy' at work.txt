Ex-Google workers' AI startup to make people 'happy' at work

Humu, an artificial intelligence (AI) startup by three former Google employees, claims to make people 'happy' at their jobs. The AI tool uses some of the people-analytics programmes developed by Google to study behavioural changes in an organisation's employees. It then uses emails and text messages to ‘nudge’ individual employees into small actions that advance the larger goal.
