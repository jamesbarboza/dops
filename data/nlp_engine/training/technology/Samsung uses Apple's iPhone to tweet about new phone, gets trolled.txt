Samsung uses Apple's iPhone to tweet about new phone, gets trolled

South Korean smartphone maker Samsung was trolled after its promotional Twitter account in Nigeria used an iPhone by rival Apple to tweet about Samsung's new smartphone, Galaxy Note 9, on Sunday. The @SamsungMobileNG account was shut and the tweet was deleted after the mistake was widely shared online. "Someone's getting fired tomorrow," a person tweeted in response to the mistake.
