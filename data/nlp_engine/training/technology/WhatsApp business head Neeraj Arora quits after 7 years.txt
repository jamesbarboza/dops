WhatsApp business head Neeraj Arora quits after 7 years

WhatsApp's Chief Business Officer Neeraj Arora has announced he'd be quitting the messaging platform "to recharge and spend time with family". Arora joined WhatsApp in 2011 from Google and was rumoured to be WhatsApp's next CEO after Co-founder Jan Koum's departure in April. "Time flies for sure but not memories...deeply indebted to (Co-founders) Jan and Brian," the IIT-Delhi graduate wrote.
