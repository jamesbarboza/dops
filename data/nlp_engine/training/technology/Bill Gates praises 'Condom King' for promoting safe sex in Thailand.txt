Bill Gates praises 'Condom King' for promoting safe sex in Thailand

Microsoft Co-founder Bill Gates has praised activist Mechai Viravaidya, known as 'Condom King', for his efforts to encourage safe sex and family planning in Thailand. "He made contraceptives readily available throughout the country, and even launched a chain of restaurants named Cabbages and Condoms," said Gates. "When people in Thailand want a condom, they ask for a 'Mechai'," added Gates.
