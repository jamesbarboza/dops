Honda makes toy car to calm crying babies with engine sounds

Honda researchers have created a stuffed toy car that uses car engine sounds to calm crying babies. The researchers said the engine sounds successfully calmed 11 out of 12 babies aged six months to 1.5 years. Researchers said that the induced comfort could be a result of similarity between low-frequency engine sounds and the sounds made in the mother's womb.
