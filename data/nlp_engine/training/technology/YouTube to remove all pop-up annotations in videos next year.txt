YouTube to remove all pop-up annotations in videos next year

YouTube on Tuesday announced that it will remove all existing pop-up annotations in videos starting January 15, 2019. Launched in 2008, the desktop-only feature allowed creators to add text, links and highlights to their video after it had gone live. YouTube discontinued the annotations editor last year, keeping creators from editing existing or creating new annotations.
