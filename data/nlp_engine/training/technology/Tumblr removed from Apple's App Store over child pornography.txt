Tumblr removed from Apple's App Store over child pornography

Blogging platform Tumblr has been removed from Apple's App Store due to child pornography that bypassed the platform's filters. The company said a routine audit that wasn't part of the industry database discovered the content on the platform. "We immediately removed this content. Content safeguards are a challenging aspect of operating scaled platforms," Tumblr added in a statement.
