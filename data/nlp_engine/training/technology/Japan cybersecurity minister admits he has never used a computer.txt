Japan cybersecurity minister admits he has never used a computer

Yoshitaka Sakurada, deputy chief of Japan's cybersecurity strategy office admitted in the parliament on Wednesday that he has never used a computer. "Since the age of 25, I have instructed my employees and secretaries, so I don't use computers myself," the 68-year-old said. Sakurada also appeared confused when asked about whether USB drives were in use at Japanese nuclear facilities.
