Google has closed a $1-billion deal to acquire a 51.8-acre property near its Mountain View, California headquarters. The newly acquired site is reportedly larger than the property that accommodates the company's current Googleplex headquarters. A Google representative confirmed the $1 billion purchase price for the office park but did not reveal any details about the deal.
