90% free apps on Play Store share data with Google: Study

Nearly 90% of free apps on the Google Play store share data with Google's parent company Alphabet, according to an Oxford research. The data, which includes age, gender, location, and information about other apps, can be used for purposes including targeted advertising or political campaigns, the research added. Google said the research mischaracterised some "ordinary functions" of apps.
