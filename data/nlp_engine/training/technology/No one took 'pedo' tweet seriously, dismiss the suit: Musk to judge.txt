No one took 'pedo' tweet seriously, dismiss the suit: Musk to judge

Billionaire Elon Musk has asked a judge to dismiss a defamation lawsuit by British caver Vernon Unsworth whom he called a paedophile on Twitter. He argued that no one could have taken his comments seriously, especially because they were made on "rough-and-tumble Twitter platform". Musk said his insults were made in the middle of a "schoolyard spat on social media".
