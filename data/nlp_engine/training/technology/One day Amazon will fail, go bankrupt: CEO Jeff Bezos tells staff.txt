One day Amazon will fail, go bankrupt: CEO Jeff Bezos tells staff

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos reportedly told employees at a meeting that he predicts one day Amazon will fail and go bankrupt. "Amazon is not too big to fail...If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years," he said. Bezos added that Amazon's job is to delay failure by focussing on its customers.
