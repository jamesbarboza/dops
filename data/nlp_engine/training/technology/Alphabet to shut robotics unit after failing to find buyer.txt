Alphabet to shut robotics unit after failing to find buyer

Google parent Alphabet is planning to shut down its robotics unit called Schaft that develops bipedal robots aimed at helping out in disaster efforts. It comes after talks with Japan's SoftBank for an acquisition of the robotics unit fell through. "We're working with employees to help them find jobs elsewhere within or outside of Alphabet," a company spokesperson said.
