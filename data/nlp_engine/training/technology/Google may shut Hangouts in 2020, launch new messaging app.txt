Google may shut Hangouts in 2020, launch new messaging app

Technology giant Google may reportedly shut down its messaging platform Hangouts for users by 2020. "Hangouts as a brand will live on with G Suite's Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet, the former intended to be a team communication app," the report said. Google may roll out an RCS (Rich Communications Services) messaging service on Android by early 2019, reports added.
