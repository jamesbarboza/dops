Contractual Google employees write to CEO demanding equality

Temporary, vendor and contractual employees at Google wrote to CEO Sundar Pichai on Wednesday to protest discrimination against them. They demanded the same benefits as full-time workers, such as paid leave, high-quality healthcare, bonuses and access to company-wide communication. “It is clear that we will continue to be mistreated and ignored if we stay silent,” they wrote in the letter.
