Chinese firms have offered subsidies to workers on the purchase of Huawei phones, while others have imposed fines and reportedly threatened to expel those using iPhones. This comes after Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on suspicions of violating US trade sanctions. Over 20 Chinese companies said they would increase the purchase of Huawei products.
