Elon Musk won't be smoking weed in public again: NASA chief

US space agency NASA's Administrator Jim Bridenstine said that SpaceX founder Elon Musk won't be smoking weed in public again. The billionaire sipped whiskey and smoked marijuana during a 2.5-hour video podcast in September. "I will tell you, he (Musk) is as committed to safety as anybody, and he understands that that was not appropriate behavior," Bridenstine said.
