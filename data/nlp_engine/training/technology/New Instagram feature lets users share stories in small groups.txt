New Instagram feature lets users share stories in small groups

Facebook-owned photo-sharing app Instagram has said it's rolling out a new feature called 'Close Friends' that will let users build a single private list of their close friends and share stories exclusively with them. The feature will appear on users' profiles in the side menu. Users will see a green badge while viewing others' stories if they're on their list.
