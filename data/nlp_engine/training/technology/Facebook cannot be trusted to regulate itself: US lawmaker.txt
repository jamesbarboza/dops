Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself: US lawmaker

US Representative David Cicilline has said, "Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself." Citing a New York Times report on Facebook's efforts to deal with a series of crises, Cicilline also said, "This...makes clear that Facebook executives will always put their massive profits ahead of the interests of their customers." "It is long past time...to take action," he added.
