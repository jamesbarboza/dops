Huawei gear to be removed from UK emergency services network

Britain's BT Group will remove Huawei equipment from the core part of a $3-billion communications network it is developing for the UK's police and other emergency responders. BT has been removing Huawei equipment from its own core 3G and 4G networks since acquiring EE, which used Huawei gear, in 2016. The expenses of the conversion will be borne by BT.
