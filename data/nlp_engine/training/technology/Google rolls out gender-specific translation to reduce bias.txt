Google rolls out gender-specific translation to reduce bias

Technology major Google has started rolling out a feature which provides both feminine and masculine translations for some gender-neutral terms on Google Translate website in a bid to reduce gender bias. The feature is currently available only for a few languages, with plans of expansion. "And we're already thinking about how to address non-binary gender in translations," the company added.
