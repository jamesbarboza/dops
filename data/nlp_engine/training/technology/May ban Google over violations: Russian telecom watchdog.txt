May ban Google over violations: Russian telecom watchdog

After Russia imposed its minimum fine of 500,000 roubles (around $7,500) on Google on Tuesday, telecom watchdog Roskomnadzor has warned it may ban the technology giant. The fine came over Google's failure to comply with the state registry of banned websites and exclude banned content from search results. Russia may change legislation to help block Google, Roskomnadzor deputy head said.
