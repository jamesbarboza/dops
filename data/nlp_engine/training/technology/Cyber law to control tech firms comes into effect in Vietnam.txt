Cyber law to control tech firms comes into effect in Vietnam

Vietnam's cybersecurity law, which tightens government control over technology and internet firms, came into effect on Tuesday. The new law requires internet firms to take down any content which the government deems "toxic" and directs companies like Google and Facebook to hand over user data on government request. The law had been approved by the government in June 2018.
