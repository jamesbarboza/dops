Dating app for Trump fans says it'll sue liberals who try to join

Righter, a soon-to-be-launched dating app for US President Donald Trump's supporters, has warned that it'll sue liberals who try to join the platform. Christy Lawton said she created Righter to cater to those conservatives who've been rejected on mainstream dating apps over their political beliefs. The app's male users can be reported if they don't pay for the first date.
