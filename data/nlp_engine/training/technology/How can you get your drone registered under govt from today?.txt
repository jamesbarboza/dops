How can you get your drone registered under govt from today?

The government began the registration process for drones on Saturday, however, drones which weigh less than 250 grams will not need to go through the registration process. Drones weighing above 250 grams need to be registered on DGCA's website to get a Unique Identification Number (UIN). Users will be required to do a one-time registration of drones, pilots and owners.
