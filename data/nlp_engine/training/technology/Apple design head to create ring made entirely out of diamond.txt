Apple design head to create ring made entirely out of diamond

Jony Ive, Apple's Chief Design Officer, has created a ring with industrial designer Marc Newson, made entirely out of a lab-made diamond. The diamond block will be faceted with several thousand facets, some of which are as small as several hundred micrometers. The ring will go up for auction at Sotheby's (RED) Auction to raise money for HIV/AIDS programs.
