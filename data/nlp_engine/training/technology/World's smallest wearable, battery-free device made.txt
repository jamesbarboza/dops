World's smallest wearable, battery-free device made

Northwestern University researchers have developed the world's smallest wearable, battery-free device that measures exposure to light, including UV radiations. The solar-powered waterproof device interacts wirelessly with a user's phone, scientists said. It enables precision phototherapy for certain health conditions and can help track exposure for people with high risk of skin cancer, they added.
