We don't run Google by referendum: CEO Pichai on walkouts

After Google employees staged mass walkouts to protest the company's handling of harassment cases, CEO Sundar Pichai said, "We don't run the company by referendum." "There are many good things about giving employees a lot of voice, out of that we've done well," he added. Google had said it fired 48 employees over the last two years for sexual misconduct.
