Facebook no longer best place to work, slips to rank 7 in US

Facebook is no longer the best place to work and has slipped down to rank 7, according to job site Glassdoor’s ‘2019 Best Places to Work’ list for the US. Management consulting firm Bain & Company has topped the list. Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica data scandal and controversial Russian involvement in 2016 US presidential elections could reportedly have caused the drop.
