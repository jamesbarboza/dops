Working with Indian coders painful: Hacker who challenged UIDAI

French hacker Robert Baptiste, who challenged UIDAI's security earlier this year, on Monday tweeted, "I used to work with Indian developers and sometimes it's very painful." "Seriously, you are a senior developer and you don't know how to use git?" he tweeted. "There are plenty of good developers in India...but...if you don't know something be curious," he further said.
