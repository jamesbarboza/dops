Not bothered about this race: T-Series on YouTuber PewDiePie

Amidst the "race" to gain the top spot of the most subscribed YouTube channel, T-Series Managing Director Bhushan Kumar said that he is "not bothered about this race". The 41-year-old added, he doesn't know why "PewDiePie is taking this so seriously". Earlier, a PewDiePie fan had hacked 50,000 printers, causing them to print messages encouraging people to "help defeat T-Series".
