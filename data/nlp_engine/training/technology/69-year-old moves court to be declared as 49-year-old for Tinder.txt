69-year-old moves court to be declared as 49-year-old for Tinder

Emile Ratelband, a 69-year-old Dutch man, has moved the court to be legally declared a 49-year-old to get more right swipes on dating app Tinder. He said he did not feel “comfortable" with his official age as it did not reflect his "emotional state." "When I’m on Tinder and it says I’m 69, I don’t get an answer," Ratelband added.
