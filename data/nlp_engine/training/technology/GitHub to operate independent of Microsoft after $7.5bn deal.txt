GitHub to operate independent of Microsoft after $7.5bn deal

On completion of Microsoft's $7.5-billion acquisition of GitHub, the coding platform's CEO Nat Friedman has said that GitHub will operate independent of its owner. "This means...GitHub will retain its developer-first values...and open extensibility," Friedman wrote in a blog post. Adding that GitHub will retain its product philosophy, he also said, "My job is to make GitHub better for you."
