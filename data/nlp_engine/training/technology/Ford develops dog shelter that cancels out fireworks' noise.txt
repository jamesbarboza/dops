Ford develops dog shelter that cancels out fireworks' noise

Ford has developed a prototype of noise-cancelling shelter for dogs to protect them from noise of fireworks. Microphones inside the shelter detect the sound of fireworks and a built-in audio system emits opposing frequencies that reduce the noise significantly. Ford said that this is "the first in a series of initiatives... that applies automotive know-how to help solve everyday problems".
