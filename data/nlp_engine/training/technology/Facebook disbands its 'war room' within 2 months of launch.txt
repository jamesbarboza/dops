Facebook disbands its 'war room' within 2 months of launch

Facebook disbanded its 'war room' within two months of launch in favour of a strategic response team, a company spokesperson has said. The strategic response team attempts to handle critical and time-sensitive situations, said Justin Osofsky, VP of global operations. The 'war room' was launched to quickly spot and fix issues like misinformation during the US midterm elections.
