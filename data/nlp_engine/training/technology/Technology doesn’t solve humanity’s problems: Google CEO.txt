Technology doesn’t solve humanity’s problems: Google CEO

Google CEO Sundar Pichai in a recent interview said, "Technology doesn’t solve humanity's problems. It was always naive to think so." Adding that technology is an "enabler", he said, "humanity has to deal with humanity’s problems." "I think we’re over-reliant on technology as a way to solve things and...over-indexing on technology as a source of all problems”, he further said.
