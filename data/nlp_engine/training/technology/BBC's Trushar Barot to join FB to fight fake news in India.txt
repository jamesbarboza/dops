BBC's Trushar Barot to join FB to fight fake news in India

BBC’s Digital Launch Editor in Indian languages, Trushar Barot, has announced that he will be joining Facebook to fight fake news in India. Barot, who joined BBC in 2001, will “lead and develop integrity initiatives for Facebook" in the country. This comes after the Indian government asked all global internet and social media platforms to appoint local grievance officers.
