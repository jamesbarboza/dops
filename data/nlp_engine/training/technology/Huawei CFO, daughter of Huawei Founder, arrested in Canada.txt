Huawei CFO, daughter of Huawei Founder, arrested in Canada

Meng Wanzhou, the Chief Financial Officer of Huawei and daughter of Founder Ren Zhengfei, has been arrested in Canada, reportedly on suspicion that she violated US trade sanctions. This comes after US President Donald Trump signed a bill that would ban government agencies from using several Huawei products. Meng is being sought for extradition by the US, Canada said.
