Google parent halts glucose-detecting contact lens project

Google parent Alphabet's life sciences division Verily on Friday said that it has decided to put on hold its project to develop a contact lens that measures glucose levels of people with diabetes. The project aimed at embedding tiny sensors on contact lenses to measure blood sugar levels in tears. Verily cited "insufficient consistency" in data for halting the project.
