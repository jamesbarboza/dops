Instagram bug exposes passwords of some users

A bug on Facebook-owned photo-sharing app Instagram, linked with the tool that allows Instagram users to download a copy of their data, exposed the passwords of some users. The bug, now fixed, sent some users' passwords in plaintext in the URL when they accessed the tool. These passwords were also stored on Facebook's servers.
