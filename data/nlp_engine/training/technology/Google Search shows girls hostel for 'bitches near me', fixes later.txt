Google Search shows girls hostel for 'bitches near me', fixes later

A glitch in the Google Search showed women's hostels, paying guest options and even girls' schools on searching for 'bitches near me'. Google Maps also showed similar results on searching for the same. Google fixed the glitch after several users posted screenshots of Google Search and Google Maps online, with a user saying, "Google needs to fix this.
Not funny."
