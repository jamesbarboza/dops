No 'blanket power' to 10 agencies to snoop on computers: MHA

A Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) senior official has said that the government hasn't given any "blanket power" to ten agencies to intercept information from any computer. The official added that agencies must strictly adhere to existing rules in order to conduct such action. Earlier this month, MHA had sent a notification listing ten agencies authorised to intercept electronic communication.
