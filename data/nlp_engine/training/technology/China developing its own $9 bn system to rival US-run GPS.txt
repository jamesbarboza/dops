China developing its own $9 bn system to rival US-run GPS

China is developing a $9 billion global navigation system to rival and eventually replace the US-run GPS in the country. The alternative system, called BeiDou, is set to be implemented in a wide variety of systems including smartphones, autonomous cars, planes and ships. BeiDou, which is currently operational in China and neighbouring regions, will be globally available by 2020.
