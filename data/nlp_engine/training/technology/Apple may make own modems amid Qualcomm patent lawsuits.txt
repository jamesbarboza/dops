Apple may make own modems amid Qualcomm patent lawsuits

Apple is reportedly planning to self-produce its cellular network modems amid existing lawsuits with US-based chipmaker Qualcomm over patents and royalty. Qualcomm has accused its client Apple of trading its secrets with rival chipmaker Intel and alleged it owed $7 billion in royalty payments, which Apple had halted in 2017 citing unfair patent licensing practices.
