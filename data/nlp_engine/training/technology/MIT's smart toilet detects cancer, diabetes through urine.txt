MIT's smart toilet detects cancer, diabetes through urine

Researchers at MIT and the European Space Agency have developed a smart toilet called 'FitLoo' which screens human waste like urine to detect diseases like cancer and diabetes. The toilet has sensors which send the data gathered directly to users' smartphones to monitor health. It is based on automated sample testing technology used by astronauts aboard the International Space Station.
