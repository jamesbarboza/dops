India's 1st 'cryptocurrency ATM' in Bengaluru shut, owner arrested

India's first cryptocurrency ATM, which was not operational yet, was closed down on Tuesday within a week of its installation in Bengaluru and its owner Harish BV, the co-founder of Unocoin was arrested. Police said the kiosk was set up without requisite permissions from the government. India does not recognise cryptocurrency as legal tender, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said earlier.
