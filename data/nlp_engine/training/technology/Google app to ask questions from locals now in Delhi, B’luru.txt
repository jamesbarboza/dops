Google app to ask questions from locals now in Delhi, B’luru

Google’s neighbourhood-focused question-and-answer app ‘Neighbourly’ on Wednesday launched in Delhi and Bangalore, after debuting in Mumbai in May. It lets users ask questions about events, places and services in their neighbourhood with voice recognition support. “We know that most of life happens within 1km from home or work and... many information needs are local,” Google said in a blog post.
