China removes 9,800 social media accounts of news providers

Chinese internet regulator Cyberspace Administration of China has removed 9,800 social media accounts of independent news providers for posting politically harmful content on the internet. It summoned social media giants, including Tencent’s WeChat and Sina-owned Weibo, warning them against failing to prevent “uncivilised growth” and “all kinds of chaos” among independent media on their platforms.
