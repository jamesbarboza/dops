Autonomy will always have some constraints: Waymo CEO

Google's self-driving car unit Waymo's CEO John Krafcik has said that even though driverless cars are truly here, "autonomy always will have some constraints". Adding that the technology is "really, really hard", Krafcik also said, "You don't know what you don't know until you're actually in there and trying to do things." Waymo started working on autonomous vehicles in 2009.
