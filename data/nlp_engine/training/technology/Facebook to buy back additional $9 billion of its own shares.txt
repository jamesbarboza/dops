Facebook to buy back additional $9 billion of its own shares

Social media giant Facebook's Board approved a buyback of an additional $9 billion worth of its shares on Thursday, a regulatory filing showed. "Board had previously authorised repurchases of up to $15 billion...under the program since it commenced in 2017," the filing said. "This increase is incremental to the prior authorisations... repurchase program doesn't have an expiration date," it added.
