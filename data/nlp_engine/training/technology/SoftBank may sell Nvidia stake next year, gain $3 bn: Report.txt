SoftBank may sell Nvidia stake next year, gain $3 bn: Report

Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is reportedly planning on selling its stake in the US graphics chipmaker Nvidia early next year. The Masayoshi Son-led firm could make a profit of around $3 billion, the report said. It added that a 48% fall in Nvidia's shares since its peak on October 1 has caused SoftBank to lean towards the sale of its stake.
