Google adds indoor maps feature on 'Find My Device' app 

Google has introduced an indoor maps feature on its 'Find My Device' app that will show users indoor layouts of airports, shopping centres or large buildings to help them find their smart devices. The app, which was launched last year, also lets users see their smart devices on a map based on their current or last known location.
