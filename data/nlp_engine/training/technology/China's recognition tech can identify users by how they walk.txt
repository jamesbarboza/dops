China's recognition tech can identify users by how they walk

China's artificial intelligence company Watrix has developed a surveillance software called 'gait recognition' that uses people's body shapes and how they walk to identify them. The company's CEO Huang Yongzhen said its system can identify people from up to 50 metres away, even with their face covered. The technology is already being used in Beijing and Shanghai, reports claimed.
