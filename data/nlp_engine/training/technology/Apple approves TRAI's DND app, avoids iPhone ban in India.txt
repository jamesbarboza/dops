Apple approves TRAI's DND app, avoids iPhone ban in India

Apple has agreed to add the Do Not Disturb (DND) app by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on its App Store. The iPhone maker was in a conflict with the regulatory body for around two years, citing user privacy concerns. TRAI in July had imposed a deadline of January 2019 to avoid a ban on iPhones in India.
