Australian startup developing smart ear tags to track cows

Australian startup Ceres Tag is working with the country's national science agency to develop smart ear tags for tracking cows. The GPS-enabled device will allow farmers to locate and monitor their animals thereby reducing risks and operating costs, improving efficiency and assisting with traceability, the startup said. Further, it would deliver data similar to the one by consumer smart watches.
