Audi, Airbus show autonomous electric car which can also fly

Audi, Airbus and Italdesign have unveiled an autonomous electric car concept called 'Pop.Up Next' which can also fly. In the test flight, the flight module accurately placed a passenger capsule on the ground module, which then drove autonomously. The prototype was a quarter-scale demonstration model of the vehicle, which Audi said could be deployed "as soon as the coming decade".
