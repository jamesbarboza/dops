French foreign ministry confirms hackers stole website data

The French foreign ministry on Thursday confirmed that ‘Ariane’, its website for citizens travelling abroad, had been hacked and users’ personal data had been stolen. “The information does not include sensitive financial material or data likely to disclose destinations," the ministry said. The website was set up in 2010 to enable French citizens to receive security-related updates while abroad.
