Google ends unlimited free storage for some video formats

Google's image and video storage service Google Photos has announced that certain video formats will no longer be supported by the platform. The technology giant said unsupported videos uploaded after December 6 will be counted in its storage quota. It further added that restricting Google Photos from automatically compressing content will also result in taking up the storage quota.
