Apple to wait till 2020 to release first 5G iPhone: Report

Apple will reportedly wait till 2020 to release its first 5G iPhone. The decision reportedly could be a result of Apple’s dispute with Qualcomm and its switch to Intel as its sole provider of chips. Intel’s current 5G chip is reportedly facing problems with heat dissipation and power consumption and it would not have a viable chip ready before 2020.
