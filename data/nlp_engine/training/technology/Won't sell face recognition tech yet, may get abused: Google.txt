Won't sell face recognition tech yet, may get abused: Google

Google on Thursday revealed it will not sell its facial recognition technology until it can come up with policies to prevent its misuse. The technology needs considerations "to ensure its use...avoids abuse and harmful outcomes," Google Senior VP of Global Affairs Kent Walker said. "It's up to all of us to ensure that AI is developed responsibly," he added.
