NY Police to use drone for 1st time to monitor Times Square

Police will deploy a camera-equipped drone above New York City's Times Square on New Year's Eve for surveillance purposes. The machine will be used along with "counter-drone technology" to block other devices from the area. Police vehicles and helicopters will also be deployed to secure the premises, where there are reportedly expected to be two million people.
