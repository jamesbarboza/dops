Railways develops AI robot 'USTAAD' to check for faults

Railways has developed an artificial intelligence-powered robot to check for faults in trains called USTAAD, which stands for 'Undergear Surveillance Through Artificial Intelligence Assisted Droid'. The robot examines parts of coaches in real time with an HD camera and transmits them over Wi-Fi. "The camera...can be rotated in any direction as per command given by the engineers," Railways said.
