No settlement talks among Qualcomm, Foxconn in Apple dispute

Apple’s group of contract manufacturers including Foxconn are not in settlement talks with Qualcomm in the Apple dispute, according to the group’s lead attorney. Qualcomm had sued the group last year over alleged non-payment of patent royalties related to Apple products. The group had then countersued Qualcomm for $9 billion over alleged illegal patent royalties.
