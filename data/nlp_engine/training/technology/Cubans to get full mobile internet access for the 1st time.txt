Cubans to get full mobile internet access for the 1st time

Cuban citizens will be able to fully access the internet on their mobile phones for the first time on Thursday after the government announced the launch of 3G service. Cuba had authorised home Internet in 2017 and constructed public Wi-Fi connection points in 2015. Prior to this, citizens were only able to access state-run email accounts on their mobile phones.
