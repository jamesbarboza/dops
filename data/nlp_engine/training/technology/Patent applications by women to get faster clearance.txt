Patent applications by women to get faster clearance

Patent applications filed by female innovators will get examined faster, as per a proposal by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP). "The move would help in promoting women entrepreneurship in the country," an official said. DIPP is targeting reduction of time taken for patent examination and grant to 18 months by 2020, in comparison to about 5-7 years currently.
