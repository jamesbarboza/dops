Instagram removes fake followers, comments from accounts

Facebook-owned Instagram on Monday said that it has started removing fake "likes, follows and comments from accounts that use third-party apps to boost their popularity". The photo-sharing app has built machine learning tools to identify accounts that use such services. This comes after Facebook revealed it removed over 1.5 billion fake accounts across its platform from April through September.
