IIT students making app to check alcohol consumption levels

A group of IIT-Ropar students is working to create an AI-based smartphone app which can check the level of alcohol consumed by its users. The app would be fed with videos of people at various stages of intoxication, which it will use to determine if a user is drunk. The app is expected to be developed in two months' time.
