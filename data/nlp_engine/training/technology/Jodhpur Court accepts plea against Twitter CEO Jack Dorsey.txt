Jodhpur Court accepts plea against Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey

A local court in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, has admitted a petition filed by a Brahmin organisation against Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for posting an anti-Brahmanical tweet on the micro-blogging website. Dorsey's tweet showed him posing with a poster that said 'Smash Brahminical Patriarchy'. The petitioner said Dorsey's comment used coarse language that was humiliating and intolerable.
