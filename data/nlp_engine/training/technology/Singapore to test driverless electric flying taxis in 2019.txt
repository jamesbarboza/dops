Singapore to test driverless electric flying taxis in 2019

Test flights of a driverless electric flying taxi will take place in Singapore in the second half of next year, German aviation firm Volocopter has said. Resembling a helicopter, Volocopter's electric air taxis take off and land vertically and can fly two people for around 30 km. The Singapore tests follow a public demonstration in Dubai last year.
