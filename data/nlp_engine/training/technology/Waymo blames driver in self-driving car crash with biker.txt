Waymo blames driver in self-driving car crash with biker

Google spinoff Waymo on Tuesday admitted that the self-driving car driver was to blame for a crash with a motorcyclist last month. According to Waymo, the test driver of the self-driving car took control of the vehicle moments before the accident. The car would have slowed down and avoided a collision if left to its own devices, the company added.
