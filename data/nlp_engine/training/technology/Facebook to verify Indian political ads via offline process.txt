Facebook to verify Indian political ads via offline process

Facebook will verify the details of Indian advertisers wanting to run political ads on the platform through an offline process ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. It had also mailed individual advertisers and agencies asking them to provide scanned copies of address and identify proofs. Advertisers will also be visited by Facebook's India-based team, the platform further said.
