Women were abused every 30 seconds on Twitter in 2017: Study

Women were abused every 30 seconds on Twitter in 2017, according to a study by Amnesty International and Element AI. Around 1.1 million abusive tweets were sent to women, including members of the US Congress, UK MPs and journalists. â€œTwitter is a place where racism, misogyny and homophobia are allowed to flourish basically unchecked," an Amnesty International spokesperson said.
