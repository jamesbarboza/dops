$260 device acts like a human blinker to boost efficiency

Electronics company Panasonic has developed a wearable device called Wear Space which acts like a human blinker to boost workers' efficiency. Priced at $260, the device features noise-cancelling headphones which reduce surrounding noise, while its fabric blocks out movement in the user's peripheral vision. It is expected to go on sale in Japan next year and be introduced globally later.
