IBM, fragrance firm Symrise create AI to make perfumes

American firm IBM's research division and Symrise, a global producer of fragrances, have created an AI system to create perfumes. Called Philyra, the system uses machine learning to sift through several formulas, raw materials and industry trends, identifying patterns and new combinations for a new perfume. Philyra designed two perfumes, which would be launched in 2019, for a beauty company.
