The International Space Station has debuted its first interactive, free-floating artificial intelligence powered robot CIMON (Crew Interactive Mobile Companion) in a recently released video. It can be seen playing music, asking for lunchtime and telling the German astronaut conducting the demonstration, “Don’t be so mean please”. It aims to assist astronauts in space and provide companionship.
