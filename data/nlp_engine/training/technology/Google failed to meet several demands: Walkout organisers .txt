Google failed to meet several demands: Walkout organisers 

Organisers of the Google walkout to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment cases have said that Google CEO Sundar Pichai didn't address several of their core demands. Google ignored their requests including adding an employee representative to the board of directors and also failed to elevate its chief diversity officer to report directly to Pichai, they added.
