Giphy launches platform for videos lasting up to 30 seconds

Giphy has soft-launched a new platform dedicated to short-form, GIF-like videos lasting up to 30 seconds. Giphy said that the platform is a "foray into yet another media format that we believe can tell powerful, short-form stories." The page currently features over a hundred videos, which were submitted as part of Giphy's first short-form video festival held last week.
