The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has fined Facebook a maximum amount of around $645,000 allowed under the country's law over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. ICO said the data of around 1 million UK users had been put at risk by the social network. "A company of its size and expertise should have known better," Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said.
