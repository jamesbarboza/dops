New Apple Watch could help prevent skin cancer, sunburns

Apple has patented a technology for the new Apple Watch which could help prevent skin cancer, sunburns or even premature skin ageing. The patent describes a system where UV light sensors detect sunlight and track exposure over time. It then sends an alert to users based on total time and how much UV light the user has been exposed to.
