Apple to delete WhatsApp sticker apps from App Store: Report

Apple is planning to delete all WhatsApp sticker apps from its App Store for violating the company guidelines, according to a tweet by WABetaInfo. The reason that Apple gave for removing the apps was that there are too many apps with similar behaviour and design. Further, the company also said that an app should not require another app to operate.
