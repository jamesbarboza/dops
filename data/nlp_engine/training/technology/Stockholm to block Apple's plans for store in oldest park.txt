Stockholm to block Apple's plans for store in oldest park

Stockholm's authorities have announced they would block Apple's plans to build its flagship store in one of the Swedish capital's oldest places, Kungsträdgården park. Conservationists and official bodies protested against the plans saying the place holds historic importance, connecting the city to the monarchy. "City parks are a little bit holy...You can’t privatise a park," a protestor said.
