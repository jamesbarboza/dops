Apple to stop reporting how many devices it sells

Apple will stop reporting how many iPhones, Macs and iPads it sells each quarter, CFO Luca Maestri said during the company's Q4 earnings call. â€œOur product ranges for major product categories have become wider...therefore a unit of sale is less relevant for us," he said. Apple's biggest competitors don't break out unit sales in their quarterly earnings reports, he added.
