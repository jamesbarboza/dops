Qualcomm seeks China ban on iPhone XS, XR post ban on older models

Qualcomm on Thursday said it is asking to ban sales of Apple's 2018 iPhone models XS, XS Max and XR in China. This comes after a Chinese court on Monday ordered a ban on import and sale of iPhone's older models from 6S through X. Qualcomm revealed it will file the new lawsuits on the existing claims of patent infringement.
