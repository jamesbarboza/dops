Apple resumes iPhone X production amid weak XS sales: Report

Apple has resumed the production of iPhone X model in certain markets due to less than expected demand for its iPhone XS and XS Max models, according to reports. The move is "due in part" to Apple's contract requirements with Samsung Display for OLED displays. Earlier, it was reported that Apple cut production orders for all three new iPhone models.
