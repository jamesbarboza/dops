Olympics 2020 will use a judging system developed by Japanese IT firm Fujitsu which uses artificial intelligence (AI) and LIDAR technology found in autonomous cars. The system scores a gymnastics' routine based on the angles of a gymnast's joints. Senior expert of the project Shoichi Masui revealed the system will help human judges, who will not be eliminated from judging.
