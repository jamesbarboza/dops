Wearable electronic tattoos to be used for healthcare made

Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, US and University of Coimbra, Portugal have developed wearable tattoo-like circuits that can be used in different areas including healthcare, soft robotics and gaming. The circuits, made up of silver nanoparticles, are printed on temporary tattoo film. The tattoos are flexible and can maintain their functions even when deformed, a researcher said.
