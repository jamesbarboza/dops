Not planning to step down as Facebook Chairman: Zuckerberg

Facebook Co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg in an interview on Tuesday turned down speculations that he may step down as the company's Chairman. "That's not the planâ€¦I'm not currently thinking that that makes sense," he said. This comes after reports claimed investors were pressurising Zuckerberg to step down over allegations of hiring a PR firm to discredit rivals and activists.
