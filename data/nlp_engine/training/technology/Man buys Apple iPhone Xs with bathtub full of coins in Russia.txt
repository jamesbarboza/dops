Man buys Apple iPhone Xs with bathtub full of coins in Russia

A man accompanied by a group of his friends took a 350-kg bathtub full of coins to an Apple store in a Russian mall to buy an iPhone Xs. An Instagram video showed him and his friends carrying the bathtub to the store in a car. At least two scuffles broke out between the group and the mall's security guards.
