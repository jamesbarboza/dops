World's 1st 3D-printed functional e-bike made in Germany

German firm BigRep claims it has produced the world's first fully functioning e-motorbike NERA using a 3D printer. The NERA has "groundbreaking features like airless tires, embedded electronics, and forkless steering," the company said. The bike was conceptualised and developed in 12 weeks and includes 15 parts, which are all 3D printed except its motor and battery, the company added.
