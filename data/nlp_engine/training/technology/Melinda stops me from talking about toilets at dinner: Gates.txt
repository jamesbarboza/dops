Melinda stops me from talking about toilets at dinner: Gates

Talking about raising toilet awareness, world's second richest person Bill Gates at a recent event said he never thought his wife, Melinda Gates, would have to tell him "to stop talking about toilets...at the dinner table". "I never imagined that I'd know so much about poop," Gates added. He was speaking at Reinvented Toilet Expo in Beijing, China on Tuesday.
