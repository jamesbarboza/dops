Apple cuts production for all 3 new iPhone models: Report

Apple has reportedly cut production orders for all three new iPhone models launched in September. A lower-than-expected demand for the new iPhones and availability of more models have made it difficult to anticipate the components and handsets the company needs, reports added. Apple started selling the iPhone Xs and Xs Max in September, and the iPhone Xr in October.
