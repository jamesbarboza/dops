Don't think users should focus on follower count: Twitter CEO

Talking about users' emphasis on the number of followers, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey at a recent event said, "I don't think that's the number you should be focused on." Adding that it was probably unwise to include the follower count on Twitter, Dorsey also said, "Back then, we were not really thinking about all the dynamics that could ensue afterwards."
