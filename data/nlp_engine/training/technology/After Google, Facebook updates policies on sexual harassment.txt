After Google, Facebook updates policies on sexual harassment

Facebook on Friday said it will no longer require employees to resolve sexual harassment claims through arbitration, mirroring an announcement made by Google on Thursday. Such complaints could be aired openly in court, said Facebook, while adding executives of director level or higher would need to inform the human resources department when they are dating another employee at the company.
