Why blame Twitter CEO: Congress leader on poster row

After Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was criticised for posing with a 'Smash Brahminical Patriarchy' poster, Congress leader Manish Tewari tweeted, "Why blame @CreatorOfTwitt. Anti Bhrahmisam is the reality of Indian politics." "Got accentuated in the North post Mandalisation of Indian politics. We are the new Jews of India and we should just learn to live with it," he added.
