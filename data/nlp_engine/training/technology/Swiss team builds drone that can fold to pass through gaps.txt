Swiss team builds drone that can fold to pass through gaps

Zurich University and EPFL engineers have developed a drone that can shrink itself to fit through narrow gaps. "The goal... is to develop drones which can be used in the aftermath of a disaster, as for example an earthquake," a researcher said. The design was inspired by birds, which can fold their wings mid-flight, the scientists revealed.
