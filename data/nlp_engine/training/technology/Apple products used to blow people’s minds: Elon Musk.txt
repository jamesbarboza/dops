Apple products used to blow peopleâ€™s minds: Elon Musk

Talking about Apple products, billionaire Elon Musk in a recent interview said, "I still use an iPhone...But Apple used to really bring out products that would blow people's minds, you know?" Adding that now "there's less of that", Musk also said, "I don't think people are necessarily running to the store for the iPhone 11."
