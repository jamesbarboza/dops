Drones are no worse than cameraman: UK wildlife photographer

British wildlife photographer Will Burrard-Lucas in an interview said, “Drones are inherently no worse than a human cameraman in a full-sized helicopter... in terms of wildlife disturbance.” He added, “They must be used responsibly and ethically.” He further said, “Sometimes signs of disturbance are subtle, which is why it is best to work with someone who really understands the animal.”
