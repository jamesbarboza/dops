No plans to launch China search engine: Google CEO Pichai

Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Tuesday said the technology giant has no plans to launch a search engine in China. Google has faced criticism from lawmakers and employees over a search product complying with China's censorship laws. Pichai said this at the US congressional committee's hearing on 'Transparency & Accountability: Examining Google and its Data Collection, Use, and Filtering Practices'.
