Few big companies handling user data irresponsibly: IBM CEO

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty at a recent event pointed to the irresponsible handling of personal data by a few dominant consumer-facing platform companies and pushed for regulation on transparency. Arguing for more platform liability, she said, “On liability, new thinking is needed.” “Dominant online platforms have more power to shape public opinion...yet they face very little regulation,” she added.
