Imported iPhones may be hit with 10% tariff: Donald Trump

US President Donald Trump has suggested that 10% tariffs could be placed on mobile phones, like the iPhone, and laptops imported from China. "I mean, I can make it 10%...people could stand that very easily," Trump said, while adding that it "depends on what the rate is". Apple's stock fell about 1.6% in extended trading on Monday following Trump's comments.
