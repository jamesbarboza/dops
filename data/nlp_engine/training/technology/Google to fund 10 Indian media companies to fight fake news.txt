Google to fund 10 Indian media companies to fight fake news

Google has selected 10 Indian media companies among 87 organisations from 23 countries for funding under its Google News Initiative to fight fake news. Many of these projects are focused on expanding newsroom video operations and trying out new ways of reporting through video, Google said. The company's video-sharing platform YouTube had committed $25 million for the same in July.
