FB deleted ex-manager's post who said it failed black people

Social media giant Facebook temporarily deleted an internal memo, shared with its employees globally by former Partnerships Manager Mark Luckie, which had accused it of "failing its black employees and...users." Facebook had said the memo about racial discrimination violated its “community standards,” but restored it later. "Facebook has a black people problem," Luckie had said in his memo.
