Google may shut its News service in EU over tax on links

Google may reportedly shut down Google News service in the European Union (EU) if a proposed "link tax" for using news stories is implemented. According to the directive, companies must pay for work of artists and journalists which they use. The future of Google News depends on whether the EU is willing to alter the legislation, a company executive said.
